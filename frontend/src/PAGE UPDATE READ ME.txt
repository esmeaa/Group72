I updated the pages to use css modules because they are conflicting and ruining eachothers
styles.

This doesn't mean much, all you need to do is change import 'css' to import styles from 'css'
Then instead of using className="style" you use className={stlyes.style} or className={`${stlyes.style1} {styles.style2}`}

Styles are still strings can you can still use the css directly but this assures that each page's css
only effects THAT page.

The only thing that needs to be changed is that the styles variable doesn't like dashes so turn them into underscores.

Sorry for any inconvience this causes.

To update you can use this regex to start

ONE
FIND
className="([a-z]+)-([a-z]+)"
REPLACE
className="$1_$2"
FIND
\.([a-z]+)-([a-z]+)
REPLACE
.$1_$2

TWO
FIND
className="([a-z_]+)"
REPLACE
className={styles.$1}

THREE
FIND
className="([a-z]+) ([a-z]+)"
REPLACE
className={`${styles.$1} ${styles.$2}`}
