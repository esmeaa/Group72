I updated the pages to use css modules because they are conflicting and ruining eachothers
styles.

This doesn't mean much, all you need to do is change import 'css' to import styles from 'css'
Then instead of using className='style' you use className={stlyes.style} or className={`${stlyes.style1} {styles.style2}`}

If you need a dynamic class you can use styles[style] for lookup

Styles are still strings can you can still use the css directly but this assures that each page's css
only effects THAT page. this won't effect global changes like :root, button or body so try to limit usage of those.

The only thing that needs to be changed is that the styles variable doesn't like dashes so turn them into underscores.

Sorry for any inconvience this causes.

To update you can use this regex to start

ONE
FIND dashed class names in js files
className="([a-z]+)-([a-z]+)"
REPLACE with underscores
className="$1_$2"
FIND dashed class names in css files
\.([a-z]+)-([a-z]+)
REPLACE with underscores
.$1_$2

TWO
FIND regular string class names
className="([a-z_]+)"
REPLACE string from styles
className={styles.$1}

THREE
FIND two regular strings class names
className="([a-z]+) ([a-z]+)"
REPLACE strings from styles
className={`${styles.$1} ${styles.$2}`}
